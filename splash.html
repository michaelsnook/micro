    <h3>This toxic and illegal practice is going on all across the city. Join us in asking
      the BBMP to crack down on open garbage burning. </h3>
    <p>Health officials estimate that as many as 40% of Indian children suffer from
      chronic resperatory disease due to air pollution, which shortens lives, limits opportunities, and creates
      huge public health costs for us all. </p>
    <p>But we can do something about it. Open air garbage burning is one of the
      leading causes of air pollution, and it's already illegal -- now we need
      the BBMP to crack down on its own contractors who are some of the biggest culprits.</p>
