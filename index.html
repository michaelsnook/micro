    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p>This is a sample microsite that includes all of my favorite little tricks.
      It started out as an attempt to recreate the <a href="http://www.nobusinessinabuse.org">
      No Business In Abuse</a> site by GetUp, hence the logo, and a few of the design
      elements like the maroon primary color and the dual navbar.</p>

    <blockquote>But what it became is something much more. It became a model microsite
      built on Jekyll and Bootstrap SASS, plus the file structure I like, the
      floating sidebar form, the meta tags, and even some best-practice
      copy/language here and there.</blockquote>

    <div class="alert alert-success">Sign the form <span class="visible-lg-inline visible-md-inline">to the right</span>
      <span class="visible-sm-inline visible-xs-inline">below</span> to add your voice.
      We'll make sure to deliver every petition to Congress so your voice is heard.</div>

    <p>Basically all you need to do to make this your own microsite is update the
      CNAME, edit the html files in the root directory, update the config file and
      <code>site.scss</code>, and deploy. </p>
    <p>Next I'll probably add a floating "sign" button for the mobile styles
      that will zoom the viewer down to the form and drop their cursor into the
      name input.</p>
    <p>You'll also get page-specific settings (via yaml frontmatter) to decide
      whether you want acquisition lightboxes, along with the cookie JS to
      determine when it's appropriate to show them.</p>
    <p>I should probably make that "donate" link into more of a button and make
      it do something, like pop up a donate modal or take you to some page whose
      value is set in <code>_settings.yml</code></p>
    <p>There's loads more to do, I mostly just intend for this to be a repository
      for all the microsite best-practices I can think of, and done in the most
      re-useable ways I can possibly think of. </p>
    <p>Right now the site uses no custom Javascript (just than jquery and bootstrap.js)
      and only about 70 lines of SASS on top of the bootstrap and bootswatch
      includes. Keeping these sorts of interventions as rare as possible should
      make this a useful repo for folks to copy, even if your end up replacing
      the Liquid/Jekyll templates entirely, or ripping the HTML and CSS as compiled.</p>

    These data offsets relate to the height of the navbar and
    footer. If you change those you'll need to change the offsets.
