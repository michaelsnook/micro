    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p>This is a sample microsite that includes all of my favorite little tricks.
      It started out as an attempt to recreate the <em>No Business In Abuse</em>
      site[<a href="http://www.nobusinessinabuse.org">1</a>] by GetUp, hence the logo, and a few of the design
      elements like the maroon primary color and the centered dual navbar.</p>
    <blockquote>But what it became is something much more. It became a model microsite
      built on Jekyll and Bootstrap SASS, plus the file structure I like, the
      floating sidebar form, the meta tags, and even some best-practice
      copy/language here and there.</blockquote>
    <p class="text-success"><strong>Sign the form
      <span class="visible-lg-inline visible-md-inline">on the right</span>
      <span class="visible-sm-inline visible-xs-inline">below</span>
      to add your voice. We'll deliver every petition to Congress so your voice
      is heard!
      <span class="visible-lg-inline visible-md-inline">&gt;&gt;</span></strong>
    </p>

    <p>To make this your own microsite you'll need to provide your own actual
      content for your campaign, apply branding in <code>scss/site.scss</code> or with
      a new Bootswatch theme, make the form work with your back-end, and update
      config/CNAME. You still need to build a site, but all the pieces are laid
      out for you.</p>
    <p>The Jekyll/Liquid/Bootstrap/SASS setup should be easy to adapt to whatever
      framework you're using in production. (In that sense, refraining from using
      a true asset pipeline is actually sort of a feature; I'm just using
      <code>sass --watch</code> here, and cat'ing the JS with Jekyll includes.)</p>

    <div class="panel-group" id="accordion" role="tablist" aria-multiselectable="true">
    <div class="panel panel-default">
      <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingOne">
        <h4 class="panel-title">
          <a role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseOne">
            Click here to read the full text of the letter
          </a>
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingOne">
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Next I'll probably add a floating "sign" button for the mobile styles
            that will zoom the viewer down to the form and drop their cursor into the
            name input.</p>
          <p>You'll also get page-specific settings (via yaml frontmatter) to decide
            whether you want acquisition lightboxes, along with the cookie JS to
            determine when it's appropriate to show them.</p>
          <p>I should probably make that "donate" link into more of a button and make
            it do something, like pop up a donate modal or take you to some page whose
            value is set in <code>_settings.yml</code>.</p>
          <p>There's loads more to do. I mostly just intend for this to be a repository
            for all the microsite best-practices I can think of, and done in the most
            re-useable way I can. </p>
          <p>Right now the site uses no custom Javascript (just jquery and bootstrap.js)
            and only about 70 lines of SASS on top of the bootstrap and bootswatch
            includes. Keeping these sorts of interventions as rare as possible should
            make this a useful repo for folks to copy, even if you end up replacing
            the Liquid/Jekyll templates entirely, or ripping the HTML and CSS as compiled.</p>
